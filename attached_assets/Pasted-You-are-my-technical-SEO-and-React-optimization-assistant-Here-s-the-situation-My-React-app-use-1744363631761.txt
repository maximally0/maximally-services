You are my technical SEO and React optimization assistant. Here's the situation:

My React app uses Vite + TypeScript. I’ve already installed `react-helmet-async`, and I'm using it inside `App.tsx` and my `SEO.tsx` component. I've also installed `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` and `eslint-plugin-react`. The site is live at https://maximally.in and I want to make sure every page is properly SEO optimized.

Here's what I want you to do across the entire app:

1. **Route-Specific SEO Tags**  
   Update `SEO.tsx` to dynamically generate the following per route:  
   - `<title>`  
   - `<meta name="description" />`  
   - `<meta property="og:title" />`, `<meta property="og:description" />`, `<meta property="og:url" />`, etc.  
   - `<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />`  
   - `<link rel="canonical" href="https://maximally.in/{page}" />`

2. **Add JSON-LD Structured Data**  
   - On the home page: Use `@type: Organization` with my brand name and homepage.  
   - On the blog page and individual blog posts: Use `@type: BlogPosting` with headline, datePublished, author, etc.  
   - On the pricing page: Use `@type: Service` or `@type: Offer`.

3. **Add Image Lazy Loading**  
   - Wherever images are used across components, update them to use `loading="lazy"`  
   - If images are being pulled from props, make sure lazy-loading is still applied.

4. **Add Canonical URLs Consistently**  
   - Ensure that `<link rel="canonical" />` is rendered per page and matches the correct route.  
   - Enforce consistent preference for `https://maximally.in` (not www).

5. **Pre-rendering**  
   - Configure `vite.config.ts` to include `vite-plugin-ssr` or `@vitejs/plugin-react` to allow partial static rendering of routes like `/`, `/pricing`, `/blog`.

6. **Improve ESLint Rules for Accessibility**  
   - Update `.eslintrc` or `eslint.config.js` to include `jsx-a11y` and `react` rules for accessibility and proper linting.  
   - Apply automatic lint fixes if possible.

7. **404 Page Improvements**  
   - Make sure the custom 404 page includes proper meta tags and a clear message with link to homepage.

8. **Double-check Sitemap Integration**  
   - Make sure `sitemap.xml` includes all important routes (/, /pricing, /blog, etc.)  
   - If not, auto-generate the sitemap and make sure `robots.txt` references it.

9. **Mobile Responsiveness**  
   - Add viewport meta tag if missing.  
   - Make sure layout is responsive across components.

10. **Push Final Improvements**  
   - Restart the app or rebuild if needed.  
   - Ensure everything is committed and live.

DO NOT remove any existing functionality. Just improve what’s missing, fill the gaps, and optimize for Google Search Console indexing. Output diffs if you make large changes.
