Add a new section titled: "Experimental Services"

Intro paragraph:
"These aren’t your average agency offerings. We’re experimenting with unconventional, high-leverage strategies that most people aren’t even talking about yet. Since we’re testing them in the wild, we don’t charge for the marketing execution — just enough to cover costs. For a custom quote, reach out to us at rishul@reachroot.xyz."

Add the following 8 service cards:

1. Interactive Quiz Funnels

Tagline: “Because trust sells better than TikTok trends.”

5. Micro-Community Creation  
Description: We help brands build small, focused WhatsApp or Discord groups of super fans and early adopters — insane for engagement and retention.

Tagline: “Talk, don’t type. Convert better.”

8. Dark Social Content Strategy  
Description: We create content designed to be shared in DMs, private groups, and communities — where trust is highest.
