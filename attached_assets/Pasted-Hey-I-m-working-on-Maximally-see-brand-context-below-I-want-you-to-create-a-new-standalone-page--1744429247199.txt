Hey, I’m working on Maximally (see brand context below). I want you to create a new standalone page called **“AI Services (Experimental)”** that matches our tone, aesthetic, and mission.

### Page Structure:
- **Hero Section:**
  Title: “AI x Growth. Experimental. Legendary.”
  Subtext: “Explore our cutting-edge AI services — from chatbots to full automation systems. Built for those ready to move fast.”

  Add a call-to-action button:  
  **[Book Strategy Call]** or **[Get Started]**

- **Services Section (Grid Cards, ShadCN + Tailwind):**
  Use electric pixel-style cards with hover animations. Here are the service blocks (feel free to group or style them in 2–3 columns):

  1. **AI Readiness Audit** – ₹16,500 / $199  
     → “Find out how ready your biz is to use AI. No fluff. Just clarity.”

  2. **Custom Chatbot Development** – ₹49,500+ / $599+  
     → “We build AI bots that talk like humans and convert like beasts.”

  3. **LLM Integration & Fine-Tuning** – ₹1.65L+ / $1999+  
     → “Plug GPT-like power directly into your systems — tailored to your use case.”

  4. **Automation Modules (Zapier, Make, APIs)** – ₹82,500+ / $999+  
     → “Let AI do the boring stuff. From lead gen to internal ops.”

  5. **AI Strategy Session (1 hour)** – ₹10,800 / $129  
     → “Sit down with our AI nerds. Get a plan you can execute tomorrow.”

  6. **Full-Stack AI Setup** – ₹4.15L+ / $4999+  
     → “Done-for-you automation + integration + optimization. Go full Iron Man.”

- **Experimental Tag:**
  Add a small floating label or tag near the page title saying:  
  **“Experimental – Early Access”**  
  with some pixel-style animation or flicker effect.

- **Styling:**
  - Font: JetBrains Mono or similar
  - Color scheme: White, Electric Blue, Warm Red, Deep Black
  - Use pixel-style dividers, glows, and soft shadows
  - Add subtle animated sprites or icons (bots, lightning, etc.)
  - CTA buttons with hover-glitch effects

- **Bottom Section:**
  “Still not sure what fits? Let’s talk.”  
  → Button: **[Book a Free AI Consult]**

Build this as a new route `/ai-services` in the React frontend. Animate sections on scroll using Framer Motion.

Make sure everything screams **experimental + badass + Maximally.**
