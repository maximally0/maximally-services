          <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-6 text-maximally-blue">ðŸ§  From Idea to Impact â€” The Maximally Journey</h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Most teens were scrolling. Rishul was studying scrolls. Not history scrolls â€” Instagram scrolls. Marketing scrolls. Trend scrolls. Strategy scrolls.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-8">
            And what he saw?<br/><br/>
            A broken loop. Great brands were screaming into the void. Even promising products couldn't break through the noise. Agencies were stuck in cycles â€” overpriced retainers, cookie-cutter campaigns, and buzzwords without results.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-12">
            So, Rishul did what most wouldn't at 16.<br/>
            He said, "Let me fix this."<br/><br/>
            No VC funds. No big team. Just a teenager with a vision, Wi-Fi, and a dangerous level of ambition.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-6 text-maximally-red">âš¡ Why Maximally?</h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Rishul didn't want to just "market."<br/>
            He wanted to white-market â€” with clarity, precision, and purpose.<br/>
            Just like clean code, he believed marketing should be elegant, understandable, and scalable.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-8">
            So he built Maximally â€” a next-gen marketing agency that combines creative instincts with operational clarity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-8">
            We don't do jargon. We do impact.<br/>
            We don't run campaigns. We run movements.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-12">
            From growth hacks to full-stack content strategies, we help businesses go viral with structure, and scale with soul.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-6 text-maximally-blue">ðŸ§© The Gap We're Filling</h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Most agencies either lack affordability or fail at personalization. Maximally bridges that:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-none space-y-4 mb-12">
            <li className="text-base leading-relaxed">â€¢ Gen Z instinct meets business IQ</li>
            <li className="text-base leading-relaxed">â€¢ Low on fluff, high on ROI</li>
            <li className="text-base leading-relaxed">â€¢ Tuned into culture, wired for conversion</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-12">
            We're young â€” yeah.<br/>
            But our age is our edge. We grew up in the content economy. We understand scroll behavior better than any boomer-led agency ever could.
          </p>

          <h2 className="font-press-start text-2xl mb-6 text-maximally-red">ðŸ‘Š Our Vision</h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-8">
            We're not just building a marketing agency.<br/>
            We're building a movement of mindful marketers who get results, not retweets.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-12">
            If you're building something bold â€” a product, a service, or a story worth sharing â€” let's make sure the world sees it.
